This game did not recieve much popular reviews. However, we will have a deep analysis in this notebook. I will be predicting the soccer player ratings based on their attributes like Pace, passing, shooting, dribbling, skill moves, agility etc using Linear regression model.


This notebook explains in depth analysis of Fifa 22 soccer game analysis and player rating prediction using Linear regression model. 
People can look at the norebook and gain knowledge on how missing values can be handled or can be filled with apppropriate values based on the attributes. 
Data analysis part which explains how important attribute changes over time and Potential of the players which is one of the most important attribute in the game with respect to age.

Most of the data visualizations are done using seaborn which comess in handy while visualizing machine learning models.
Correlation matrix was my compelling visual which explains which attributes have to be selected for the model prediction.

Finally my model have predicted 93% accuracy which was unbelievable at the begining but it is what it is!!
